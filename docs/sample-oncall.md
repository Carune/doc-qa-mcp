# On-call Incident Checklist

When an incident starts, first identify impact scope.

- Check whether impact is global or region-specific.
- Check deployments from the last 60 minutes.
- Summarize top three error log patterns.

After narrowing down root cause candidates, choose rollback or feature-flag disable.
